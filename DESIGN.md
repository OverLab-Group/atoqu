Atoqu Design — Atomic + Quantum

- Atomic: each search mode is an independent unit.
- Quantum-inspired: multiple modes are evaluated in parallel, then collapsed via weighted ranking.
- Feedback: user choices reinforce certain modes over others.
- Optimizer: learns query patterns and adjusts mode weights.
